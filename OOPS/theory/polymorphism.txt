ðŸ”· What is Polymorphism in Python?
Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows the same interface (like a method name) to behave differently for different objects.

Simple Definition:
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling a single action to behave differently based on the object performing it.

ðŸ”¸ Types of Polymorphism in Python
1. Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
Happens when a child class overrides a method in its parent class.

Same method name, different implementation in different classes.

ðŸ”§ Example 1: Using Animal, Dog, and Cat classes
python
Copy
Edit
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Some generic animal sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow"
âœ… Calling overridden methods:

python
Copy
Edit
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

print(dog.speak())  # Output: Woof
print(cat.speak())  # Output: Meow
âœ… Using polymorphic function:

python
Copy
Edit
def animal_speak(animal):
    print(animal.speak())

animal_speak(dog)  # Output: Woof
animal_speak(cat)  # Output: Meow
2. Polymorphism with Functions and Methods
Here, different objects can be passed to a function, and the function behaves differently depending on the object type.

ðŸ”§ Example 2: Shape, Rectangle, and Circle
python
Copy
Edit
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        print("Calculating area in the base class")

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius
âœ… Polymorphic function:

python
Copy
Edit
def print_area(shape):
    print(f"The area is: {shape.area()}")

rect = Rectangle(4, 5)
circle = Circle(3)

print_area(rect)     # Output: The area is: 20
print_area(circle)   # Output: The area is: 28.26
ðŸ”¸ Polymorphism in Python vs Other Languages
In Java or C#, polymorphism is achieved through interfaces. Python doesn't have formal interfaces but supports Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) using the abc module.

ðŸ”¸ Bonus: Abstract Classes & Interfaces in Python
python
Copy
Edit
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow"
Here, Animal is an abstract base class.

Any subclass must override the speak method to avoid errors.

âœ… Summary
Concept	                Description
Polymorphism	        Same interface (e.g., method name), different behaviors for different types
Method Overriding	    Child class redefines a method from parent class
Polymorphism via funcs	Pass different objects to the same function; it behaves based on the object
Abstract Base Classes	Pythonâ€™s way of defining "interfaces" using abc module
