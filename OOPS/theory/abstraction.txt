âœ… Topic: Abstraction in Python (OOP Pillar)
ðŸ”¹ Definition of Abstraction
Abstraction is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

It means hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features to the user.

Purpose: Reduces programming complexity and effort.

ðŸ§  Real-world Examples of Abstraction
Washing Machine:

You interact with buttons (start, timer, dry) without knowing how the internal motor or dryer works.

Mobile Phones / AC Remotes / Laptops:

You press "Shutdown" or "Open App"â€”you donâ€™t see how memory is allocated or how tasks run internally.

ðŸ§ª Abstraction in Python â€“ Practical Code Example
ðŸ”¸ 1. Import Required Classes
python
Copy
Edit
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
ABC: Abstract Base Class

abstractmethod: Decorator used to define abstract methods

ðŸ”¸ 2. Define an Abstract Class
python
Copy
Edit
class Vehicle(ABC):
    def drive(self):
        print("The vehicle is used for driving.")

    @abstractmethod
    def start_engine(self):
        pass
Vehicle is an abstract class because it inherits from ABC.

start_engine() is an abstract methodâ€”has no implementation and must be overridden.

ðŸ”¸ 3. Create a Derived (Child) Class
python
Copy
Edit
class Car(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Car engine started.")
Car inherits Vehicle

Implements the start_engine() method

ðŸ”¸ 4. Function to Operate the Vehicle
python
Copy
Edit
def operate_vehicle(vehicle):
    vehicle.start_engine()
    vehicle.drive()
ðŸ”¸ 5. Use the Classes
python
Copy
Edit
car = Car()
operate_vehicle(car)
âœ… Output
csharp
Copy
Edit
Car engine started.
The vehicle is used for driving.
ðŸ§© Key Concepts Recap
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.

Any subclass of an abstract class must implement all abstract methods.

Abstraction enforces structure and hides internal logic from the user.

Promotes code reusability and cleaner design.

ðŸ’¡ Conclusion
Abstraction allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.

Real-world analogies help reinforce the concept (e.g., washing machine, mobile phone).

Python provides abc module to implement abstraction using abstract classes and methods.
