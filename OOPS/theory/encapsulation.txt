Encapsulation in Python: A Simple Explanation
The video discusses encapsulation in object-oriented programming (OOP), which is essentially about:

Bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) together in a single unit (class)
Controlling access to certain components of that unit

Access Modifiers in Python
Python has three types of access modifiers for variables:
1. Public Variables

Regular variables like self.name
Can be accessed from anywhere in the program
No special syntax required

2. Protected Variables

Created using a single underscore: self._name
Should only be accessed within the class and its subclasses (inherited classes)
Not strictly enforced by Python, but a programming convention

3. Private Variables

Created using double underscores: self.__name
Should only be accessed within the class itself
Python "name mangles" these variables (renames them internally to _ClassName__name)

Getter and Setter Methods
When you make variables private, you can still provide controlled access through:

Getter methods: Functions that return the value of a private variable
Setter methods: Functions that change the value of a private variable (often with validation)

Why Encapsulation Matters
The instructor uses a washing machine analogy:

You see buttons and openings (public interface)
You don't see the internal machinery (private components)

Benefits of encapsulation:

Protection: Prevents accidental changes to important data
Validation: Can check values before setting them (like ensuring age isn't negative)
Maintenance: Easier to modify internal workings without affecting other code

This is the first part of a two-part discussion. The next part will cover abstraction, which is about hiding complex implementation details and exposing only necessary features.
