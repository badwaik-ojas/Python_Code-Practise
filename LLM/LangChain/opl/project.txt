🧠 High-Level Concept
GPT models can’t answer questions about:

Recent events post their training cut-off.

Private/internal documents not in the public domain.

To overcome this, we use:

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Injecting external, relevant context at inference time.

Embeddings: To convert chunks of documents and queries into vectors.

Vector Databases: To store and retrieve document chunks by similarity.

🛠️ The OPL Stack Overview
Stack Component	Role
OpenAI	Provides the LLM (GPT-4) and embedding model (text-embedding-3-small).
Pinecone	Stores document chunks as vectors for semantic search.
LangChain	Orchestrates the flow (load → embed → search → prompt → answer).

📊 Pipeline Steps
✅ Step 1: Document Ingestion & Embedding
Load documents (e.g., PDFs).

Split into chunks (e.g., 500–1000 tokens with some overlap).

Generate embeddings for each chunk using OpenAI embedding models.

Store the chunks + vectors in Pinecone.

✅ Step 2: Query Processing
User enters a question.

Embed the query using the same model.

Retrieve similar chunks from Pinecone using cosine similarity.

Rank and filter top-k results.

✅ Step 3: Prompt Injection + Answer
Insert the query and retrieved chunks into a structured prompt.

Send the full message to GPT-4.

Return the answer.

📚 Definitions
Embedding: Turning text into numerical vectors so similarity can be computed.

Vector DB: A database optimized for similarity search on vector data.

Chunking: Breaking long documents into smaller, independently meaningful parts.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Combining retrieval and generation to enhance model outputs.
