Many scientific instruments are designed to detect infrared, ultraviolet, X-ray, or other
wavelengths. These invisible forms of light have no colors associated with them. So
scientists have their computers assign unusual colors (like neon orange) to their images,
to allow them to observe details. The green Sun, above left, is a photo of the Sun taken in
extreme ultraviolet light, which our eyes cannot see. The scientists have artificially
colored the ultraviolet data green. We call that “false color”.
Scientists also use false color to indicate additional information. The image of Mars,
above right, shows the concentration of methane in Mars’s atmosphere. Scientists have
color-coded the highest concentrations of methane as red, the lowest in blue, to help us
and them understand the data. Many of the images in this collection are likewise false
colored. We have tried to highlight which images come from visible light and which
represent false color or color-coded data.

The Sun is our very own star, at the center of our solar system. The Sun is scientifically
designated as a yellow dwarf (because of its place on the HR diagram1). However, our Sun
is neither yellow nor a dwarf. The Sun appears white to the human eye -- it only looks
yellow or orange when its rays are being scattered by Earth’s atmosphere during sunrise
and sunset. And it is now thought to be brighter and larger than about 85% of the stars in
the Milky Way galaxy, most of which are red dwarfs (stars with low mass that shine in a
relatively cool red).
The Sun consists of hot plasma (a state of matter where electrons have been stripped from
their atoms) interwoven with magnetic fields. It has a diameter about 109 times that of
of Earth, and a million Earths could fit inside it! Its mass accounts for about 99.86% of the
total mass of the solar system. About three-quarters of the Sun consists of hydrogen; the
rest is mostly helium. Less than 2% consists of heavier elements, including oxygen,
carbon, gold, iron, and others. Many of these elements were originally forged in supernova
explosions. So we, and everything in our solar system, are made of “star stuff”2.
Every second, the Sun fuses 614 million metric tons of hydrogen into 609 metric tons of
helium in its core. The difference is converted into gamma rays that eventually get

radiated at the solar surface as lower-energy
photons, primarily visible light. The Sun's
hot atmosphere, called the corona, continuously
expands in space creating the solar wind, a stream of
charged particles that extends beyond the solar
system. The bubble in the interstellar
medium formed by the solar wind, called
the heliosphere, is the largest continuous structure in
the solar system.

Solar Activity
Our Sun is a dynamic, active, and constantly changing star. Solar activity is driven by
intense magnetic fields, generated deep within the solar interior then buoyantly rising up
through its surface. Plasma caught in the magnetic field lines allows us to see these fields,
as in the previous composite image.

On the left is a true color image of the Sun. The dark splotches are called sunspots. The
image on the right, taken at the same time, is a map of the magnetic fields on the Sun.
White indicates a positive field, and black a negative one (grey indicates little or no field).
Note how the sunspots are associated with the magnetic fields – most activity on the Sun
is a result of complex magnetic fields!

Sunspots are temporary regions of reduced surface temperature caused by increased
magnetic activity. The Sun goes through a cycle of about 11 years when it has a period of
many sunspots (solar maximum), then few or no sunspots (solar minimum). Sunspots or
similar magnetically active regions are the source of solar storms.
The Sun’s magnetic fields are constantly in
motion. When solar magnetic fields twist,
break, and then reconnect, they can release
a tremendous amount of energy. We see
these as solar flares, like the white
brightening near the center of the image on
the right. Solar flares eject radiation and
fast moving particles that can damage
satellites, disrupt communications, and
give high-flying planes and astronauts
additional doses of radiation. Finding ways
to protect astronauts from solar flares is
one of the biggest challenges of going back
to the Moon or to Mars.

ESA3/NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) produced the
spectacular portrait (left) of our star. Featured
is a huge, handle-shaped prominence—a
cloud of relatively cooler plasma held aloft
high in the corona (the Sun’s atmosphere) by
a large magnetic field that is rooted in the
solar surface. A typical prominence extends
over thousands of kilometers, and can last
from minutes to months.
Image Credit: ESA/NASA’s SOHO spacecraft (false colors)
Sometimes prominences erupt into coronal mass
ejections (CMEs), as in the image on the right. These
huge blasts of charged plasma, traveling at 1400
km/s, can impact objects of the solar system. Luckily,
Earth’s magnetic field acts as a shield, partially
protecting us. But CME impacts on Earth may still
generate effects such as aurora, satellite drag, power
outages, communications disruptions, and GPS
interference.

A close-up view of the Sun's surface, observed by NASA’s Transition Region and
Coronal Explorer (TRACE) mission, shows vast loop structures made of superheated
plasma trapped in magnetic field lines. About 10 Earths could fit across any one of these
loops! These areas of solar activity can contain multiple loops, often in “tunnel”

formations, that can persist for weeks. The plasma reaches temperatures of more than
1,000,000 C° — whereas the Sun’s surface temperature averages only about 5500 C°!
Flares and CMEs usually erupt from active regions such as these.
Space Weather
Image Credits: NASA (Definitely not to scale!)
Space weather refers to the affect the Sun has on the Earth and rest of the solar system.
The solar wind is a fairly constant stream of charged particles, mostly high-energy
electrons and protons, ejected from the upper atmosphere of the Sun. These particles can
escape the Sun's gravity because of their high kinetic energy and the high temperature of
the corona. As the solar wind buffets the Earth’s magnetic field, it distorts it into a long
oval, as shown in the (not-to-scale) image above.
Radiation storms and CMEs have the potential to seriously affect Earth and our modern
technology. Besides triggering beautiful aurorae, these solar storms can damage
satellites, disrupt power grids and electrical systems, interfere with cell phones and other
communications, and disturb animal movements. They can even threaten astronauts and
high-flying airplanes with their radiation! Space weather affects not only Earth but the
other planets as well.
Our Eye on the Sky – Launched in February
2010, NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) mission is designed to study the Sun’s
variability and its effect on space weather, with
the goal of eventually predicting dangerous
solar activity.

a dwindling white dwarf.

Mercury is extreme. Of all the planets in our
solar system, it is the smallest, it has the
oldest surface, it is closest to the Sun, it has
the largest daily variations in surface
temperature, and, until recently it was the
least explored. NASA’s Mercury Surface,
Space Environment, Geochemistry, and
Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft, which
inserted into Mercury orbit in March 2011
has changed all that! It has revealed rocky
Mercury’s geologic history, the nature of its
weak magnetic field, the structure of its
core, and the composition of its thin
exosphere. MESSENGER has even found
hints of water at Mercury’s dark poles.

What is the source of the radiating streaks in the image on the left? It is the impact crater
Hokusai, seen at the top of the frame, named for Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai. Its
impressive ray system extends for as far as 1000km. Such rays are formed when an impact
excavates material from beneath the surface and explodes it outward from the crater. Rays
such as these fade over time as they are exposed to the harsh space environment. Hence,
craters with bright rays are thought to be relatively young.

The image on the left features the sprawling
Caloris basin, one of the solar system's
largest impact basins. Created during the
early history of the solar system by the
impact of a large asteroid-sized body, the
basin spans about 1500 kilometers and is
seen in yellowish hues in this enhanced
color mosaic. The image data is from the
January 14th flyby of the MESSENGER
spacecraft. Orange splotches around the
basin's perimeter are now thought to be
volcanic vents, new evidence that Mercury's
smooth plains are indeed lava flows.

Venus
Heaven or Hell?

Venus, second planet from the Sun, has roughly the same size, mass, density, and
composition as Earth. Until the 1960s, scientists and science fiction writers speculated that
Venus might be very Earth-like, and home to lush, tropical forests. That view changed when
new observations confirmed a superheated surface with temperatures over 400C and
atmospheric pressures nearly a hundred times that of Earth. But the biggest difference from
Earth lies within Venus’s atmosphere. The clouds on Venus, which hide its surface, are
made not of water like they are on Earth, but rather of concentrated sulfuric acid—
essentially battery acid. About 700 million years ago, just before life was diversifying on
Earth, Venus experienced tremendous volcanic activity, flooding the surface with new lava
and filling the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, causing a runaway greenhouse effect.
Volcanoes continue to erupt on Venus.
Only radar can probe through the thick clouds in the Venusian atmosphere to make
observations of the surface. Radar data collected over many years from multiple sources
were used to create the beautiful, color-coded portrait of Venus’s surface, above right.
This striking image, right, is
a composite of the complete
radar image collection of
Venus’s surface, obtained

began mapping the surface of Venus in September 1990. Magellan spacecraft operations
ended on October 12, 1994, when radio contact was lost with the spacecraft during its
controlled descent into the deeper portions of the Venusian atmosphere.

Was there life on Venus? There is evidence that when it was young, Venus almost
certainly had liquid water—an essential ingredient for life on Earth. Was Venus habitable in
the past? Is it habitable now? Finding evidence of past life will be a big challenge, as
massive volcanic activity caused a resurfacing of 80% of the planet within the last billion
years. But if samples are someday returned from the ancient surface of Venus, they could be
very revealing!
As for life on Venus now, some scientists speculate that single-celled organisms could
actually survive within the harsh yet stable atmosphere, living off the sulfur chemistry there!

Goddard scientist Norman Kuring, the images have the perspective of a viewer looking

In December of 1968, the Apollo 8 crew flew from the Earth to the Moon and back again.
Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders were launched atop a Saturn V rocket,
circled the Moon ten times in their command module, and returned to Earth on December
27. As the Apollo 8 command module rounded the farside of the Moon, the crew could
look toward the lunar horizon and see the Earth appear to rise. The famous picture that
resulted, below left, shows a distant blue Earth above the Moon's limb, and was a
marvelous gift to the world.

For those who have seen them, the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis are spectacles to
remember. Aurorae are caused by currents of energetic charged particles in Earth's
magnetosphere flowing through the upper atmosphere. The interaction of the solar wind
with Earth's magnetosphere drives these currents. The more active the Sun, especially
during the peak of its 11-year solar cycle, the more charged particles flow to Earth’s
magnetic poles. These charged particles eventually collide with gas molecules in the
upper atmosphere, causing them to ionize (lose electrons) and emit colored light.
Earth’s thin atmosphere is all that
stands between life on Earth and
the cold, dark void of space. Our
planet's atmosphere has no clearly
defined upper boundary but
gradually thins out into space.
The layers of the atmosphere have
different characteristics, such as
protective ozone in the
stratosphere and weather in the
lowermost layer. The setting Sun
seen through Earth’s atmosphere
is featured in this image, which
was photographed by the crew of
the International Space Station in

ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN…one giant leap for mankind! There is only one world in
our solar system besides Earth on which humans have walked—the Moon. The image
above was taken by astronauts on the Moon during the Apollo 17 mission in December
1972. Astronaut Harrison Schmitt is shown preparing to take a soil sample. The later
Apollo missions, including 17, had a strong scientific focus. A few days after this image
was taken, humanity left the Moon and has yet to return. Note the Sun in the upper left. It
is daytime on the Moon, but with no air to scatter the light, the sky remains black.

Far Side of the Moon

Virtually everyone can see the Moon, no matter where on Earth they are. Most people
know that the Moon’s gravitational pull on the Earth causes our ocean tides. But did you
know that missions to the Moon have discovered the existence of Moonquakes, as well as
water ice hidden in the permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles?
The lunar samples brought back by Apollo astronauts have shed new light on how the
Moon was formed—it is now thought that roughly 4.5 billion years ago, a rocky impactor
about the size of Mars hit the young Earth. The debris scattered by that collision orbited
the Earth briefly (only about a month!) before coalescing into the Moon. The Moon was
further struck by a heavy bombardment of asteroids around 3.9 billion years ago, causing
much of the cratering now seen. The dark blotches on the Earth-facing side of the Moon
are lunar mare, essentially large, dark plains of basalt formed by volcanic eruptions.

Why does the Moon have a reddish
hue in these images of a lunar eclipse?
It is the same reason that the Sun
appears reddish during a sunset:
scattered light. During a lunar eclipse,
the Earth is situated directly between
the Sun and the Moon. The only
sunlight reaching the Moon travels
through dense layers of Earth's
atmosphere. Atmospheric particles
preferentially scatter out shorter
(bluer) wavelengths leaving only the
longer (redder) wavelengths to refract
(bend) through the atmosphere and
illuminate the Moon.
Meteors and Impacts

The meteor fireball on the left, caused
by a Geminid meteor, is one of the
largest ever recorded. Most meteor
showers result from debris that “boils”
off a comet when it passes close to the
Sun. When Earth passes through the
debris, these specks may enter our
atmosphere and we see a meteor
shower!
Though most particles which cause our
brilliant meteors are about the size of a grain of sand, the Geminids are different. Their
source of meteors is not a comet, but a strange, rocky object thought to be either an
asteroid or an extinct or dormant comet.
Meteors that are larger than a grain of sand (often chunks from asteroids) can sometimes
reach the Earth’s surface, as did the rock on the left image below. This one landed in the
Sudan desert. Meteors that make it to the ground are called meteorites; large ones can
leave impact craters (2 images below right).

The Red Planet

Mars has been the subject of intense study
for centuries. Its exploration has been
wrought with success and failure, and has
witnessed a dramatic evolution in
knowledge. Speculations about the famous
“irrigation canals” on Mars in the late
1800s were finally put to rest by images
returned from NASA’s Mariner 4 mission
in 1965. Revealing icy deserts, impact
craters and a barren landscape, they
dispelled thoughts of thriving, agricultural
civilizations. In the 1970s NASA’s Viking
mission carried out life-detection
experiments on the surface. The results,
suggesting a lifeless planet, raised more
questions than answers.
The next two decades were met with struggle as several spacecraft from the US, Japan,
Europe, and former USSR were lost. Success resurfaced in the late 1990s with the ESA
orbiter Mars Express and NASA’s Pathfinder rover, and Global Surveyor and Odyssey
orbiters—heralding the mantra “Follow the Water.” In 2004, NASA’s twin rovers Spirit
and Opportunity began work. NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Phoenix lander
followed. As data from these robotic explorers piled up, so did evidence that Mars
preserves a record of surface liquid water and possibly once-habitable environments.
NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory, which arrived in 2012, carried an unprecedented suite
of instruments that can bring us one step closer to determining if life ever started on
Mars. Its Curiosity rover is now offering a human-like perspective to martian landscapes.
ESA's Mars Express obtained this view
of an unnamed impact crater located on
Vastitas Borealis, a broad plain that
covers much of Mars's far northern
latitudes. The circular patch of bright
material is residual water ice. The
colors are very close to natural, but the
vertical relief has been exaggerated
three times. This patch of ice is present
all year, remaining after frozen carbon
dioxide overlaying it disappears during
the martian summer.

NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft
took this spectacular image of Victoria
Crater, an impact crater near the equator of Mars
where hematite mineral deposits suggest Mars
had a wet past. Layered sedimentary rocks are
exposed along the inner wall of the crater, and
the floor of the crater is occupied by a striking
field of sand dunes. NASA’s twin Mars
Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, have
been operating on the surface of Mars in search
of answers about the history of water on the Red
Planet since 2004 (unfortunately, Spirit was
turned off). Five days before this image was
taken in September 2006, the ‘Opportunity’
rover arrived at the rim of Victoria Crater, after a
drive of more than 9km! It explored within the
crater, staying at the site for about a year. The
rover can actually be seen in this image as a
small dot at the ‘ten o'clock’ position along the
crater rim.

Chasma Boreale, pictured above, is a long valley that cuts deep into the north polar ice
cap of Mars. Where the ice cap has retreated, sand from earlier, less icy climatic regimes
is exposed. Winds have shaped them into dunes. In 2007, NASA’s Phoenix mission
landed in the northern arctic plains of Mars to study the history of water and potential
habitability in the ice-rich soil. Phoenix verified the presence of water ice in the martian
sub-surface, and found calcium carbonate, an indicator of a less acidic (more potentially
habitable) planet in the past. Phoenix even observed snow falling from clouds in the
martian atmosphere! This eerily Earth-like vista was made by combining data from
NASA's Mars Odyssey and Global Surveyor orbiters.

The intriguing image on the left depicts the Nili Fossae region of Mars, which occupies
an area between a large volcano and an ancient impact basin. It is home to a collection of
curved troughs cutting about 500m into the crust. The European spacecraft Mars Express
detected clay minerals there, good news for astrobiologists because the clays suggest the
presence of water at some point in the past. Even better, the minerals also suggest that the
water collected in pools on the surface, a possibly comfortable habitat for life.
Signs of water on Mars, above right, were discovered some time ago but scientists had no
idea about much of the mineral composition of Mars. A recent discovery suggests that
much of the planet was covered with water around 4 billion years ago.
Astrobiologists have also detected the presence of methane gas in the atmosphere of
Mars, indicating that the planet is indeed “alive,” either in a geologic or biologic sense. It
is still unclear whether the methane was produced by purely geologic processes such as
the oxidation of iron, or by microscopic organisms living in the martian sub-surface.
Finding plumes of it that persist only during the martian spring and summer indicates that
some ongoing, seasonal process is releasing the gas. Methane-producing microbes were
one of the earliest forms of life on Earth, so if there is life on Mars today, it could be
making the methane from carbon dioxide in the martian atmosphere.
It may look like a familiar sight, but
this sunset is not from Earth. This
lovely, otherworldly evening was
captured by the rover Spirit in 2005 as
it peered toward the western sky from
its perch in Gusev Crater on Mars. Like
no other spacecraft, the Mars
Exploration Rovers have afforded us a
perspective much like our own on
another world, making Mars feel that
much more like home.
