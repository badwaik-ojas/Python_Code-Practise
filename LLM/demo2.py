'''
Under the hood, this pipeline selects a default LLM (large language model), configures it, and processes the input 
text, producing a summary. While this approach is quick and easy, there may be times when youâ€™ll want more control 
over how the pipeline operates. This is where configuring the pipeline becomes useful.

article_text = "I woke up early. did my breakfast, went for shopping. It was a calm day"
summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
summary = summarizer(f"summarize: {article_text}" )
