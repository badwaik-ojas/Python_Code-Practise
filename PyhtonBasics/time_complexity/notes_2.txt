🧠 Topic: Asymptotic Analysis and Notations
🎯 Goal of Asymptotic Analysis
To measure the efficiency of an algorithm (mainly time complexity).

Without depending on:

Machine-specific factors (hardware, OS, etc.)

Actual implementation of the algorithm.

It helps us compare algorithms mathematically based on how they grow with input size, not exact timings.

📏 What It Measures
We are not interested in:

Exact time taken (in seconds or milliseconds).

We are interested in:

Order of growth of operations based on input size n:

Linear?

Quadratic?

Logarithmic?

etc.

🧮 Asymptotic Notations
There are 3 major notations:

1. 🅾️ Big-O Notation (O) – Worst Case
Describes the maximum time or upper bound the algorithm will take.

Most commonly used in interviews and analysis.

✅ Example:
A runner says: "No matter what, I won’t take more than 10 minutes to finish 100m."

For an algorithm: "No matter what input, it won’t take more than O(n) time."
If n = 100, then it may take up to 100 steps. If n = 1000, then up to 1000 steps.

2. 🅱️ Omega Notation (Ω) – Best Case
Describes the minimum time or lower bound the algorithm will take.

Used when analyzing best-case performance.

✅ Example:
A runner says: "I can complete 100m in at least 10 seconds if everything is perfect."

For an algorithm like Insertion Sort, if you give it a sorted array, it can finish in Ω(n) time.

But Bubble Sort might still need O(n²) time even for sorted input.

3. 🅿️ Theta Notation (Θ) – Average Case
Describes the average time or tight bound: both upper and lower bounds are the same.

✅ Example:
A runner says: "On average, I finish 100m in 5 minutes."

For an algorithm: "On average input, I will take Θ(n log n) steps."

💡 Why These Notations?
Helps predict how an algorithm will behave as input grows.

Let’s compare algorithms fairly without running them on every possible input or every possible machine.

📝 Summary Table
Notation	Case	Description	Example Analogy
O	Worst	Maximum time taken	Max 10 mins to run 100m
Ω	Best	Minimum time taken	Min 10 secs to run 100m
Θ	Average	Average time taken	Avg 5 mins to run 100m
