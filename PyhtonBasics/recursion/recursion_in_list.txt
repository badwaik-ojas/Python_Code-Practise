📘 Topic: Recursion with Lists/Arrays in Python
🔁 Core Idea of Recursion
Recursion means solving a big problem by breaking it into smaller similar subproblems.

Lists (or arrays) are good candidates for recursion because they can be broken down easily.

🧠 How to Think Recursively with Lists
Think about how to break the list into smaller parts.

Apply recursion on the remaining parts.

Combine the result as needed.

🧩 Techniques to Divide Lists in Recursive Problems
✅ 1. First or Last Element Approach
Work on first or last element, and recursively solve the rest of the list.

Steps:

Write the base case (e.g., if list has 0 or 1 elements, it's already sorted).

Check a condition for the current element (e.g., is arr[0] <= arr[1]).

Recursively check the rest (e.g., arr[1:] or arr[:-1]).

Example use case: Check if array is sorted.

✅ 2. Start-End Index Approach
Pass start and end indexes instead of creating new lists.

Very useful in:

Binary Search

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

This is more memory-efficient than slicing, as it avoids creating new arrays.

You break the problem by selecting the middle index, then call recursion on the halves.

Use:

start, mid

mid+1, end

✅ 3. Copying the Array (Less Efficient)
Create a new subarray using slicing and send it to the recursive function.

Easy to write, good for learning or debugging.

But it uses more space and is less efficient than using start/end indexes.

Avoid for performance-critical tasks.

🔍 Why Understand These Techniques?
Helps you think clearly about how to break down problems.

Gives you frameworks you can reuse in coding interviews.

Makes it easier to apply recursion to new or unfamiliar problems.

🔄 Example Problem to Practice
Problem: Write a recursive function to check if a list is sorted.

Goals:
Use recursion to solve the problem.

Understand and implement:

Recurrence Relation

Recursion Tree

Both Head and Tail recursion

📌 General Framework for Recursive List Problems
Base Case: Smallest input size (e.g., length 0 or 1).

Work on one part: Usually one element or the middle.

Recursive Call: Call the function on the smaller subproblem.

Combine/return result.

💡 Tips
Understand the thought process, not just the final solution.

Focus on:

Why you are breaking the list this way.

What you are checking at each step.

How recursion helps in solving the problem.

Once you're comfortable, shift from slicing (technique 3) to using index ranges (technique 2) for efficiency.

Term	Meaning
Base Case	The simplest version of the problem (stopping condition).
Recursion Tree	Diagram showing recursive calls and how they break the problem.
Head Recursion	Work is done after the recursive call.
Tail Recursion	Work is done before the recursive call.
Recurrence Relation	Equation that defines the recursive logic (e.g., f(n) = f(n-1)).
