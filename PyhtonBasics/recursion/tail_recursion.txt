Head vs Tail Recursion - Complete Guide
What is Head Recursion?
Head recursion is when you make the recursive call first, then do calculations with the result.
Key Characteristics:

Recursive call happens at the beginning of the function logic
You wait for the recursive call to return a result
Then you process/calculate something with that result
Work happens after the recursive call returns

What is Tail Recursion?
Tail recursion is when the recursive call is the last thing you do in the function - no calculations after it.
Key Characteristics:

Recursive call happens at the end of the function
No work is done after the recursive call returns
You just return whatever the recursive call gives you
Often uses an accumulator to build up the result

Tail Recursion Example - Factorial
pythondef factorial_tail(n, accumulator=1):
    # Base case - just return accumulated result
    if n == 0:
        return accumulator
    
    # Do calculation BEFORE recursive call
    # Then make recursive call (this is the LAST thing we do)
    return factorial_tail(n - 1, accumulator * n)

Real-World Analogy: Collecting Homework
Head Recursion (Collecting Homework):
Imagine you're in class and need to collect all homework from students behind you:

You ask the person behind you: "Collect all homework and bring it to me"
You wait in your seat (using memory/stack space)
That person asks the person behind them, and they wait too
This continues until the last person
Everyone waits until homework comes back up the chain
Each person adds their homework to the pile before passing it forward
Everyone stays in their seat until the task is complete

Memory Usage: Everyone has to stay and wait = lots of memory used
Tail Recursion (Passing Homework Forward):
Now imagine a different approach:

You do your work first - put your homework in the pile
You pass the pile to the person behind you and say "add your homework and pass it back"
You can leave - you don't need to wait!
Each person adds their homework and passes it along
Each person can leave after passing the pile
The last person returns the complete pile to the teacher

Memory Usage: People can leave after doing their part = much less memory used
Technical Benefits of Tail Recursion
Memory Optimization (Tail Call Optimization)

In head recursion: All function calls stay in memory until the end
In tail recursion: Previous function calls can be removed from memory

Why This Happens:

In head recursion, each function needs to "remember" where it was to do work when the recursive call returns
In tail recursion, there's no work to do after the recursive call, so the function can be safely removed from memory

Language Support:
    Python: Does NOT automatically optimize tail recursion (but some languages do)
    Other languages (like some functional languages): Automatically optimize tail recursion
    Result: Tail recursion can use much less memory in optimized languages

When to Use Each Type
    Use Head Recursion When:
    The logic naturally fits (like tree traversals)
    You need to process results as they come back up
    The recursive depth won't be too large
    Code readability is more important than memory optimization

Use Tail Recursion When:
    You want better memory efficiency
    Working with very deep recursion
    The problem can be solved by "accumulating" results
    You're working in a language that optimizes tail calls
