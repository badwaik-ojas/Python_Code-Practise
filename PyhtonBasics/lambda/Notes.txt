Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined using the **lambda** keyword. They can have any number of arguments but only one expression. They are commonly used for short operations or as arguments to higher-order functions.

#syntax
lambda arguments: expression

addition = lambda a,b: a+b

The map() function applies a given function to all items in an input list (or any other iterable) and returns a map object (an iterator). This is particularly useful for transforming data in a list comprehensively.

The map() function is a powerful tool for applying transformations to iterable data structures. It can be used with regular functions, lambda functions, and even multiple iterables, providing a versatile approach to data processing in Python. By understanding and utilizing map(), you can write more efficient and readable code.

The filter() function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. It is used to filter out items from a list (or any other iterable) based on a condition.

The filter() function is a powerful tool for creating iterators that filter items out of an iterable based on a function. It is commonly used for data cleaning, filtering objects, and removing unwanted elements from lists. By mastering filter(), you can write more concise and efficient code for processing and manipulating collections in Python.
