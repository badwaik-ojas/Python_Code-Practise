'''
You are given the speed of a vehicle and the time it has traveled. Your task is to compute and return the distance traveled by the vehicle.

Formula:

To calculate the distance traveled by a vehicle:

Distance=SpeedÃ—Time

Input: speed = 60, time = 2
Output: 120.0
 
Input: speed = 50.5, time = 1.5
Output: 75.75
