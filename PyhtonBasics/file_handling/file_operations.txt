Python File Operations Overview
✅ 1. Reading a File
Read Entire File at Once
python
Copy
Edit
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Mode used: "r" (read mode)

Common Error: File not found (FileNotFoundError) if the file doesn’t exist.

Note: Only reads the content; cannot write in this mode.

Read File Line by Line
python
Copy
Edit
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # Removes newline characters
Uses strip() to remove trailing \n characters.

Iterating over the file object reads it line-by-line.

✅ 2. Writing to a File
Overwrite File Content
python
Copy
Edit
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello World\n")
    file.write("This is a new line\n")
Mode used: "w" (write mode)

Effect: Overwrites entire file content.

Use Case: Creating or resetting file content.

Append to a File
python
Copy
Edit
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Appended line\n")
Mode used: "a" (append mode)

Effect: Adds content to the end of the file.

Safe: Does not remove existing data.

✅ 3. Writing Multiple Lines at Once
python
Copy
Edit
lines = ["First line\n", "Second line\n", "Third line\n"]
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.writelines(lines)
Appends a list of lines.

Make sure each line in the list ends with \n.

✅ 4. Working with Binary Files
Write Bytes to Binary File
python
Copy
Edit
with open("example.bin", "wb") as file:
    file.write(b"Hello World in binary")
Mode used: "wb" (write binary)

Data: Written as bytes (prefix with b).

Read from Binary File
python
Copy
Edit
with open("example.bin", "rb") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Mode used: "rb" (read binary)

Output: Byte content (e.g., b'Hello World in binary')

✅ 5. Copy Content from One File to Another
Copy from source to destination
python
Copy
Edit
with open("example.txt", "r") as source_file:
    content = source_file.read()

with open("destination.txt", "w") as destination_file:
    destination_file.write(content)
Use Case: Creating a backup or transforming file content.

Behavior: If destination.txt doesn’t exist, it will be created.

✅ File Modes Cheat Sheet
Mode	Description
"r"	Read (default); file must exist
"w"	Write; overwrites file or creates new
"a"	Append; adds to end or creates file
"r+"	Read + Write
"w+"	Write + Read (overwrites file)
"a+"	Append + Read
"rb"	Read in binary mode
"wb"	Write in binary mode
"ab"	Append in binary mode

✅ Common Tips
Always use with open(...) as file: – it automatically closes the file.

Use file.read() to read all at once, or iterate line-by-line for memory efficiency.

Use strip() to remove unwanted newline characters.

Always be careful with "w" mode—it erases file content.
