📌 Topic: Bubble Sort - Notes and Expert View
1. What is Sorting?
Definition: Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order (usually ascending or descending).

Importance:

Helps in efficient searching.

Commonly used in real-world applications like sorting products by price/date on e-commerce platforms.

Widely used in databases for fetching latest or relevant records.

2. Introduction to Bubble Sort
Concept: Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Mnemonic: Imagine forming a “bubble” around two adjacent elements.

Goal: With each pass, place the next largest (or smallest) element in its correct position.

3. Bubble Sort - Working Mechanism
Let’s assume ascending order for clarity.

Example Array:
[12, 25, 11, 34, 90, 22]

Pass-by-Pass Observation:
Pass 1: Largest element "bubbles" to the end.

Result: [12, 11, 25, 34, 22, 90] — 90 at correct position.

Pass 2: Next largest bubbles up.

Result: [11, 12, 25, 22, 34, 90] — 34 at correct position.

Pass 3: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 90] — 25 in place.

Pass 4 & 5: Array becomes fully sorted.

Key Observations:
After every pass:

The next largest element moves to its correct position.

Total passes required = n - 1 for an array of length n.

Each pass reduces the effective array size by 1 (as the end portion is already sorted).

4. Implementation Strategy (Python Perspective)
Two Nested Loops:
Outer Loop (for passes): Runs from 0 to n - 1.

Inner Loop (for comparisons): Compares adjacent elements from 0 to n - pass - 1.

Key Points:
Swap if arr[j] > arr[j + 1].

With each outer iteration, ignore the last i elements as they are sorted.

Optimization (expert tip): If no swaps happen in a pass, break early — the array is sorted.

5. Python Pseudocode:
python
Copy
Edit
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        swapped = False  # Optimization: track if any swap happened
        for j in range(n - 1 - i):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        if not swapped:  # No swaps in this pass => already sorted
            break
6. Time & Space Complexity
Case	        Time    Complexity	Reason
Best Case	    O(n)	Already sorted, with early exit
Average Case	O(n²)	Nested comparisons & swaps
Worst Case	    O(n²)	Completely reversed array
Space	        O(1)	In-place sorting, no extra space used
