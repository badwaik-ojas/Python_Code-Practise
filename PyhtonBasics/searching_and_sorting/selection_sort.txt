🔍 What Is Selection Sort?
Selection Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element (from the unsorted part) and placing it at the beginning of the array.

It divides the array into two parts:

Sorted part (starts empty)

Unsorted part (initially the entire array)

🧠 Core Idea / Philosophy
In every pass (or iteration), find the minimum element from the unsorted portion.

Swap it with the first unsorted element, expanding the sorted part of the array by one.

After n − 1 passes, the array is sorted.

✅ Steps in Selection Sort
Start from the first element.

Find the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array.

Swap it with the element at the current position.

Repeat for the next position.

🧾 Example
Given array:
[12, 25, 11, 34, 90, 22]

Pass 1:
Find minimum from [12, 25, 11, 34, 90, 22] → 11

Swap with first element → [11, 25, 12, 34, 90, 22]

Pass 2:
Find minimum from [25, 12, 34, 90, 22] → 12

Swap with 25 → [11, 12, 25, 34, 90, 22]

Pass 3:
Find minimum from [25, 34, 90, 22] → 22

Swap with 25 → [11, 12, 22, 34, 90, 25]

Pass 4:
Find minimum from [34, 90, 25] → 25

Swap with 34 → [11, 12, 22, 25, 90, 34]

Pass 5:
Find minimum from [90, 34] → 34

Swap with 90 → [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 90]

Pass 6:
Only one element left, array is sorted.

💡 Intuitive Analogy
Imagine students standing in a line of random heights:

You (the teacher) want to sort them from shortest to tallest.

You look through all students to find the shortest.

Bring the shortest to the front of the line.

Then, repeat the process from the next student onward.

🔧 Implementation Tip
To implement in Python:

python
Copy
Edit
def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]
    return arr

# Example
arr = [12, 25, 11, 34, 90, 22]
print("Sorted array:", selection_sort(arr))
