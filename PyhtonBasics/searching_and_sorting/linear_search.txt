🔍 Topic: Searching and Sorting in DSA (Python)
🔹 Why It Matters:
Searching and sorting are fundamental operations in any algorithm or data-driven application.

Many real-world problems require efficiently locating data or organizing it for faster access.

Mastery of these algorithms is essential for coding interviews, problem-solving, and system design.

🔎 Linear Search Algorithm – Detailed Breakdown
✅ Problem Statement:
Given a list (array) and a target value, find the index where the target exists.
If not found, return -1.

🧠 Concept:
Traverse the list sequentially from start to end.

Compare each element with the target.

If found, return index.

If entire list is traversed without a match, return -1.

📌 Example:
python
Copy
Edit
arr = [10, 23, 45, 70, 11]
target = 70
# Output should be 3 (because 70 is at index 3)
🧑‍💻 Python Implementation:
python
Copy
Edit
def linear_search(arr, target):
    size = len(arr)
    for index in range(size):
        if arr[index] == target:
            return index
    return -1
✅ Example Usage:
python
Copy
Edit
my_list = [10, 23, 45, 70, 11]
result = linear_search(my_list, 70)  # Output: 3
print(result)

result = linear_search(my_list, 700)  # Output: -1
print(result)
🔄 Execution Flow (Step-by-Step via Python Tutor Visualization):
Function linear_search() is called with a list and a target.

A loop starts from index 0 to n-1.

At each step:

Current index and element are compared with the target.

If a match is found, the function returns the index immediately.

If the loop completes with no match, it returns -1.

After function completes, it exits memory (frame destroyed).

🧠 Key Takeaways and Expert Insights:
🟩 Strengths of Linear Search:
Simple and easy to implement.

Works on unsorted lists.

Good for small datasets or when no prior knowledge about data structure exists.

🟥 Limitations:
Inefficient for large lists – time complexity is O(n).

Does not leverage any ordering in data (unlike binary search which requires sorted data).

🧪 Testing and Learning Environment:
You can copy-paste your solution into platforms like Udemy’s coding exercises or Python Tutor to visualize step-by-step execution.

Practice each coding exercise to solidify your understanding – aim for 60–70% success rate minimum.

🧭 Final Notes:
Functions are temporary: They exist in memory only during execution and are destroyed after returning a value.

Be comfortable with:

Function calls

Loop mechanics

Return values and scope

Focus on code tracing and visualization to understand what’s happening behind the scenes.
