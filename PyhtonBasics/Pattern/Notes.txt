Pseudo Code is simple way of describing an algorithm in plain language or mix of code like natural language instruction

example: addition of 2 number

Begin:
    num1
    num2
    addition = num1 + num2

    return addition
end

Process to Solve:
    1. Analyze: Input, Output, Constraints
    2. Break down the problem into small parts: 
    3. Remember/enlist the concept
    4. Take some example or ask: Clear out confusion
    5. Write a Pseudo Code
    6. Dry run from the Pseudo Code you wrote
    7. Write down your solution
    8. Lookout of the edge cases
